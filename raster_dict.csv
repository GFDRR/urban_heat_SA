Cooling degree hours: Annual number of hours during which the temperatures rises over 25°C, multiplied by the number of degrees the temperature rises above 25°C. This is an international standard to estimate the energy demand for air conditioning use.

CSDI: Cold spell duration index. Annual number of days with at least six consecutive days when the night temperature < 10th percentile

Heatwave days: Number of heatwave days per year calculated following the definition of the South African Weather Service. If the maximum temperature at a particular town is expected to meet or exceed 5 degrees C above the average maximum temperature of “the hottest month” for that particular place (this is 32°C for Johannesburg & Ekurhuleni), as well as persisting in that mode for 3 days or more (https://www.weathersa.co.za/home/weatherques)
